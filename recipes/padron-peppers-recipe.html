    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Serve these padron peppers as a side dish or starter as part of a Spanish-inspired feast. They're simple to make, require little prep and take five minutes to cook.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>500g padron peppers</li>

    </ul>
 

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a high heat, or if using an air-fryer, heat to 205C for 3 mins. Fry the peppers, stirring frequently, for 5 mins until blistered and wilted. The peppers should be soft and slightly charred.</li>
        <li>Transfer the peppers to a serving plate and season with some sea salt. Serve with dips or as part of a tapas spread, if you like.</li>
