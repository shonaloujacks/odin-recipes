    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Achieve three of your five-a-day with our potato hash. Peppers are packed with vitamin C and spinach is rich in iron – a great combo with hearty potatoes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>340g baby potatoes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp rapeseed oil</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 green pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tarragon leaves</li>
        <li>160g baby spinach</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>

    </ul>
 

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the potatoes for 15-20 mins until almost tender, then scoop into a bowl using a slotted spoon. Keep the water for later.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and cook the onion for 5 mins, stirring frequently until starting to colour. Add the pepper and cook for 5 mins more.</li>
        <li>Crush the cooked potatoes using a masher. Stir them into the onion and pepper, along with the paprika and tarragon. Cook for 5-10 mins, turning them over occasionally so they brown.</li>
        <li>Return the potato water to a low heat. Add the spinach to the hash and stir through to wilt. Crack the eggs into the potato water once it’s simmering and poach them for a few minutes until cooked to your liking. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon. Serve the hash topped with the eggs and serve.</li>
    </ol>
